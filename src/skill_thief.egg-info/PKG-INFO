# Skill Thief

Skill Thief is a Python CLI for installing and updating Agent Skills from git repositories or local paths. It reads a project-local `.skill-thief.yaml`, downloads skills (optionally from subdirectories), validates them against the Agent Skills spec, and installs them into your configured skills directory.

## Features
- `skill-thief install [name ...]` — install skills defined in config (all or selected)
- `skill-thief update [name ...]` — update installed skills to latest ref
- `skill-thief list` — view configured skills and install status
- Supports git URLs (https/ssh), optional branch/tag/commit refs, and local paths
- Validates that each installed skill contains a `SKILL.md` with required YAML frontmatter
- Optional validation via `skills-ref` if available in PATH (warnings only)

## Configuration
Create a `.skill-thief.yaml` in your project root:

```yaml
version: 1
install_path: ./skills
skills:
  - name: pdf-processing
    source: git+https://github.com/acme/skills.git
    ref: main
    subdir: skills/pdf-processing
  - name: local-skill
    source: ./third_party/skills-repo
    subdir: skills/local-skill
```

Rules:
- `install_path` optional; default `./skills`.
- `skills` list entries require `name` and `source`.
- `source` accepts git URLs or local paths. `ref` optional; `subdir` optional.

## Usage
```
pip install skill-thief
skill-thief install       # installs all skills
skill-thief install foo   # installs just foo
skill-thief update        # updates all skills
skill-thief list          # shows config and status
```
